![#project-title](#path-to-project-title)
![#project-badge](#link-to-project-badge)

#project-description
```
The `#project-title` is required to be a relative path to an project banner, based on the template provided in the Assets repository. This should be stored in the 'docs\assets\\' as 'project-title.png'. Avoid external links.


The `#project-badge` is optional. When used these should be listed one after another. 

A `#separator` must sit between the header section and the description.

A short discription about the project will follow the separator
