## Usage

The project title image can be found referenced at the top of a repository `README`.

#### Local Styles

Update the `Primary` local style to the primary/dominant colour from the project icon.

### Exporting

Select the `project-title` root frame layer and ensure that the `Fill` property is hidden. Use the `Export` section at the bottom, with `PNG` format selected.
